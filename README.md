# Music-Note
This project is for SK Planet Industry Cooperation Project (2020.3~ 2020.7)

## A Brief Overview
- Our goal is to promote the Busan One Asia Festival (BOF) through AR events
- We developed the application named "Music Note" using ARCore that guides users to the event site and makes the way enjoyable

## User Scenario
(1) Users run the downloaded app when they arrive at Haeundae Station.   
When a user looks at the phone screen through the app, a screen with album covers of k-pop singers on the street appears. Those icons are placed on the way from Haeundae Station to the festival venue, and users can follow them.   
(2) Music plays when the user approaches the placed album image in the screen.   
(3) The notes come down to the rhythm of the music, and when the user clicks the notes in time with the beat, a score is earned.   
(4) When a user arrives at the festival and visits the booth, prizes are awarded according to the score.
